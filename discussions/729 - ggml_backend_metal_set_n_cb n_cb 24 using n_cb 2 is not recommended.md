## 📄 Description

Hello.  I have been spending a lot of time trying to tune a moe model to get the max response time out of it.  This line keeps showing up in the logs once a prompt is initiated.  I see where the log is set in source, tried to for to 2 without much success so far.  Any thoughts with this error and how to handle it?   Thank you.
